#Bella, The Webpage Assistant

#PROJECT DESCRIPTION
These days, virtual assistants such as Siri, Cortana, Google assistants, 
Amazon Alexa and many more are used to help users ease many tasks such as
looking up the weather, making a note and setting a remainder. 
Many a times, people want to create much more than that, like an app or a website. 
Now with this open source application, we enable virtual assistants to do just that.

#PROJECT FEATURES
USAGE
The app is a mock up of a virtual assistant that helps the user seamlessly 
create a web page by simply taking suggestions from the user on 
what they want the website to look like.

USAGE EXAMPLE
Create a personal web page using Bella. Simple commands such as 'Create a webpage called Resume',
'set background image' and 'set title color to red' will help the user understand the 
functioning of the application.
